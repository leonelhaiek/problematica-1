<br>

<p>The Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine was awarded Monday to researchers from the United States and Britain whose discoveries<strong> helped  <br> millions of 
     lives </strong> from the ravages of blood-borne hepatitis, a major global health problem that causes cirrhosis and liver cancer.
</p>

<p>
    Harvey J. Alter, then a clinical scientist at a National Institutes of Health blood bank, showed that the chronic form of hepatitis disease,<br>
     known as hepatitis C, was blood-borne and probably caused by a virus.
</p>
<p>
    Years later, British-born virologist Michael Houghton — then working for the pharmaceutical company Chiron — found a way to clone the virus and <br> 
    to identify antibodies created against it by the immune system; this led to the development of ways to screen and eliminate the virus from the blood supply.
    <br>Through genetic analysis, then-Washington University in St. Louis researcher Charles M. Rice characterized the machinery of the virus and set scientists on a path to finding a cure. 
    
</p>
<p>
   <strong>Their research helped almost eliminate the risk of getting hepatitis C </strong> through blood transfusions and led to the development of antiviral medications <br>
    that can completely clear the virus from the bodies of infected patients.
</p>
<p>
    “<em>One of the greatest thrills for me has been having identified the first patient [with hepatitis C] and now seeing that not only he was cured, <br>
    but everyone else I’ve followed over the years was cured,”</em> Alter told reporters Monday morning.<em> “I could not have imagined this, not in my lifetime.”</em>

</p>
<p>
    The Nobel Committee called the three researchers’ work “a landmark achievement in our battle against viral infections.”
</p>
<p>
    <em>“It’s hard to find something that is of such benefit to mankind as what we are awarding this year,”</em> said Thomas Perlmann, secretary of the Nobel Committee.<br>
    <em> “This discovery … has led to improvements for millions of people around the world.”</em>

</p>
<p>
    Hepatitis viruses come in several forms: hepatitis A, which is transmitted through contaminated water or food and is rarely deadly; and hepatitis B and C, <br>
    which are carried in blood and bodily fluids and can be far more dangerous. The latter viruses are “insidious,” the Nobel Committee said, because they can <br>
    linger for years in the blood of an apparently healthy person before erupting into a dangerous disease.
</p>

<p>
    Alter, who had worked with Blumberg, spearheaded a new NIH project to create a storehouse of blood samples, which could be used to uncover the causes of the transfusion-associated disease. <br>
    He also tracked people who developed hepatitis after receiving a blood transfusion.<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/163436/"> His work showed</a> that, before 1970, 30 percent of people who got heart transplants at NIH later came down with liver disease. <br>
    Yet most illnesses weren’t caused by the A or B virus — there had to be “another infectious agent,” Karlsson-Hedestam said.
</p>

<p>
    In 1978, Alter showed that plasma from patients carrying this unknown form of hepatitis could transmit the disease to chimpanzees. The pathogen was small enough to slip through filters, <br>suggesting it was a tiny virus, rather than a bacterium.

But much about the germ remained unknown — a fact that frustrated Alter so much he was moved to write poetry. “No antigen or DNA / No little test to mark its way,” he  <a href="https://aasldpubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hep.26787" > wrote </a> in 1988.

</p>
<p>
    The experiments took the better part of a decade, Houghton wrote in a 2009 review for the <a href="https://www.journal-of-hepatology.eu/article/S0168-8278(09)00535-2/fulltext">Journal of Hepatology</a>. <br>
    The <em>“eureka moment,”</em> he said,<em> “was in fact a very gradual and extended one.”</em>

</p>
<p>
    The research led to the development of a test for screening hepatitis C in the blood supply. Since screening began in 1992, the risk of infection from a transfusion has fallen dramatically.

<p>
    The final step to characterize the virus came when Rice sequenced its genome and created a clone of the virus.<br>
     Animals injected with the clone fell ill, providing conclusive evidence the hepatitis C virus was, in fact, the cause of the disease.
</p>
<p>
    Genetic research also allowed Rice to tweak the virus so it was easier to study in a petri dish. This set the stage for the development of powerful anti-viral drugs,<br>
     which are able to eliminate the virus in more than 95 percent of treated patients, Karlsson-Hedestam said. Few other viral diseases have such an effective cure.
