        <small>  Novak Djokovic Smacks Ball Into Line Judge's Face at French Open, Oops!        </small>

    <h1> NOVAK DJOKOVIC
        OOPS, I DID IT AGAIN!!!
        Hits Ball Into Line Judge's Face At French Open    </h1>

        <h4>!!!NOT AGAIN¡¡¡</h4>
        <h5>  For the second time in a month, Novak Djokovic hit a tennis ball right into a line judge!!!    </h5>

        <p>
            This time, it was a true accident -- Novak was trying to return a serve when he lunged at the ball ... and re-directed it right at a judge's face!!! <br>

                It all went down Monday at the French Open -- Novak was battling Russian tennis player<strong> Karen Khachanov</strong>.
        </p>
       <p>
        Look at the  <a href="https://twitter.com/tennis_gifs/status/1313123133633695745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1313123133633695745%7Ctwgr%5Eshare_3&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tmz.com%2F2020%2F10%2F05%2Fnovak-djokovic-line-judge-face-french-open%2F"> video</a> .

       </p>
      
       <p>
        The good news ... unlike the incident at the U.S. Open, the line judge was uninjured this time!
       </p>
      
       <p>
        Also, unlike the U.S. Open ... French Open officials determined this was just a true accident and Novak was allowed to continue with the match. 
    </p>
   
    <p>
        The big difference from the <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2020/09/06/novak-djokovic-defaulted-disqualified-us-open-hit-judge-ball/"><strong> US Open incident  ... </strong> </a> Novak smacked a ball out of the court out of pure frustration -- it was NOT in the capacity of trying to play a live ball.  
            
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The line judge at the U.S. Open was hit in the neck and fell to her knees -- though, ultimately (thankfully) she was okay.  
    </p>
<p>
    This time, Novak -- the #1 player in the world -- went on to defeat Khachanov and advanced to the next round of the tournament.
</p>
<p>
    Word of advice to the line judges ... maybe bring a helmet next time?!
