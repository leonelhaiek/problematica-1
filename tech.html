        Crash Bandicoot, a series that kicked off in the 1990s and cemented itself as one of the best offerings on PlayStation, is back over two decades later with a new, mainline installment. <br>
        Despite being developed by a completely different studio — Toys for Bob — “Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time” finds a wonderful balance of respecting the spirit of the series Naughty Dog created, <br>
        while also modernizing it with unique and at times ingenious new touches.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Crash Bandicoot 4” sends Crash (and his sister Coco, who is also playable) across different dimensions where you fight pirates, jump across snowy chasms, journey through tropical islands and even launch into space. <br>
        Taking place after the events of 1998′s “Crash Bandicoot: Warped,” it’s up to Crash and his friends to put a stop to evil forces that aim to conquer space and time.
    </p>

    <p>
        You make your way through a world map with linear levels, each with deviously difficult challenges. For a franchise that’s best known for precision platforming, “Crash Bandicoot 4” delivers excellently on that front.<br>
         Spinning, jumping and sliding feels smoother than ever, and it’s an absolute blast to jump from one platform to the next in gorgeous environments. <br>
         One of my favorites involves platforming across urban rooftops during a festival, and carefully avoiding foes like pop-up jack-in-the-boxes or ghosts who spew fire from trumpets. It makes for a really excellent atmosphere and fun level design.
    </p>
    <p>
        A level can change at a moment’s notice, too: At one point you may be running toward the camera as a gargantuan dinosaur chases you, and the next you could be sliding across rails or vines in a similar fashion to grinding on a skateboard. <br>
        Variety is one of “Crash Bandicoot 4”'s strengths, and this extends to some new additions as well.
